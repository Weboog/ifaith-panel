1
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.131
A-ram?

2
00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:49.632
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.842
What's this movie?

4
00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.637
I thought it fits you perfectly.

5
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.681
The film producer has big movies--

6
00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.309
Hey, whoever the producer is,

7
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.061
this character isn't me at all.

8
00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.604
Well, it kind of is.

9
00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.983
This role fits you well,
and I liked the book.

10
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.485
Look at this character.

11
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:12.155
He just walks around on eggshells
with no sincerity.

12
00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.617
Well, at least it's a happy ending.

13
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.496
It's a highly confidential film.

14
00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.623
Highly confidential, my foot.

15
00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.374
So what's the title?

16
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.709
Cha In-pyo?

17
00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.836
-Cha In-pyo?
-Do I know Cha In-pyo?

18
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.713
Who doesn't know Cha In-pyo?

19
00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.590
He works out a lot.

20
00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:33.009
-The aggressive toothbrushing.
-A kind actor?

21
00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.677
-A gentleman.
-That's right.

22
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.805
-An exemplary citizen.
-A volunteer worker.

23
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:40.308
He was a superstar when I was young.
He had this gesture.

24
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:41.601
Like this.

25
00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.019
All My Love For You!

26
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.979
He was super cute in that drama.

27
00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.898
It was like this and this.

28
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.359
He was the best.

29
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.707
CHA IN-PYO SYNDROME

30
00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.418
I PROPOSED TO A NICE LADY

31
00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.699
Nice, okay.

32
00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.243
That's it. Good!

33
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.453
Good, like that.

34
00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:46.749
Okay, let's take a break.

35
00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.252
Wow.

36
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:50.962
Really, wow.

37
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.341
For the next round, let's dial it back.

38
00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.844
I never dial it back.

39
00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.972
Of course, I get it.

40
00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.725
But it's a request from the advertiser.

41
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:07.478
They want a friendly image
that makes people feel comfortable.

42
00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:10.648
This isn't a high-class brand.

43
00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.317
It's not like a "formal" suit.

44
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.651
I understand.

45
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.695
Right?

46
00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:18.990
It doesn't have to be cheap
just because it's inexpensive.

47
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:21.326
What?

48
00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.453
Why would they hire me?

49
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:25.705
My gentle image,

50
00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.498
my exemplary image,

51
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.627
and my strong image.

52
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.009
I have all the best images
an outdoor brand could ask for.

53
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.391
Right, you're the best.

54
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:50.730
You're right about that,
but let's put it this way.

55
00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:55.443
It should be like
paparazzi in your neighborhood.

56
00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:57.111
I know that feeling.

57
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.989
Let your guard down,
and they get an ugly shot of you.

58
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:03.409
Many celebrities never
leave the house without makeup.

59
00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:08.998
I, however, am always sure
to have my shit together.

60
00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:12.961
I'm sure you are.
But what I'm trying to say is--

61
00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.504
I said I got it.

62
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.215
I haven't come this far by mere luck.

63
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.055
Are you sure you got it?

64
00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:26.266
Let's get to work. I'm feeling it now.

65
00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.225
Then let's go.

66
00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:30.645
All right!

67
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.398
Let's do this!

68
00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.441
Okay.

69
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.069
Good.

70
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.780
He fucking didn't get it.

71
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.825
-Get his manager's ass here, now.
-Yes, sir.

72
00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:47.912
Level three!

73
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.377
You're so annoying.

74
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.714
I told you, he already said no.

75
00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.924
Enough already. I'm hanging up.

76
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.928
She's so clingy. Gosh, so annoying.

77
00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.848
-Shit.
-Who is it?

78
00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:09.100
My friend, a variety show writer.

79
00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:12.478
My boyfriend is Min-sik's manager,

80
00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:17.025
so she keeps calling me for favors.

81
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:21.237
What variety show?

82
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:26.242
FIRST-CLASS SECURITY

83
00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.620
You don't need to read that.
It'll be canceled.

84
00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:32.915
-Why?
-You know, the director has issues.

85
00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.584
And the story line is…

86
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.213
No, we waited so long for this.

87
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.424
We should help the team in times of need.

88
00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.427
Tell them I'll wait until they start.

89
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.470
Okay.

90
00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.662
When will you get the door fixed?

91
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.123
Sorry, I was too busy
to take it in for repairs.

92
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.628
The story changed a lot.
His character was better before.

93
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.046
He sounds dumb now.

94
00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.715
I said you don't have to read it.

95
00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:25.927
In-pyo.

96
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.472
The photo shoot had some issues.
They want to do it again.

97
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.726
They asked you to wear this
and try to look comfortable in it.

98
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.398
I like their attitude.

99
00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.733
It's a truly sincere gift.

100
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.861
You've holed up at home
since your wife left the country.

101
00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.072
Why not take
this opportunity to go hiking?

102
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.617
I'll do my best to wear these.

103
00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.412
Right, did you give them
Do-cheol's profile?

104
00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:54.455
Who's they?

105
00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.211
Do-cheol…

106
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.755
Get ready for a movie.

107
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.590
What?

108
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:09.303
There's a perfect role for you
in my upcoming film.

109
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.099
-Really?
-Hey, I've been an actor for 25 years.

110
00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.685
I can get you in.
Just have faith and be ready.

111
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:18.688
Faith in what?

112
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:20.356
Me.

113
00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.860
But the film may not even get made.

114
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:26.070
-I'll look for another--
-A-ram.

115
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.115
I wouldn't be saying this
if there was another option.

116
00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.493
He needs my careful attention,
or he won't survive.

117
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.329
I'm sorry. I was too busy
to look after Do-cheol.

118
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.706
Busy doing what?

119
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.335
The photographer seemed
upset with you in the car.

120
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.255
Don't disgrace me like that.

121
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.632
What is it you do?

122
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.719
-I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize. Just answer me.

123
00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.179
What is it you do?

124
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:52.889
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:58.978 --> 00:07:59.812
A-ram.

126
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.274
It's okay to make mistakes or be slow.

127
00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:06.068
Just have a sense of sincerity.

128
00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:07.820
Of course.

129
00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.991
I came across Min-sik earlier.

130
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:15.995
-You should try making a call.
-To Min-sik?

131
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.957
No, the variety show writer.
We worked together once.

132
00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.376
You mean Shin Hyeon-a?

133
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:25.046
She has an upcoming variety show.

134
00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:29.467
It starts big at first
with the theme "Four Great Stars."

135
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.428
Min-sik couldn't make it?

136
00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:35.139
So he recommended you instead?

137
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.517
A sub?

138
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.813
Yeah, sure.

139
00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:45.525
Anyhow, give her a call.
She's running out of time.

140
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.109
Who else is in the show?

141
00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.948
Kang-ho, Byung-hun.

142
00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:55.409
Kyung-gu.

143
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:57.912
That's it.

144
00:08:57.995 --> 00:09:00.122
Nice team. Song Kang-ho.

145
00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.333
Lee Byung-hun. Sol Kyung-gu.

146
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.920
Maybe Choi Min-sik instead of Cha In-pyo?

147
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:12.385
"Maybe"?

148
00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.305
What do you mean?
Did you forget how many movies I've done?

149
00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:19.267
You're a good fit for the show.

150
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.768
A good fit?

151
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:25.606
I mean, you deserve a spot with them.

152
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.112
Deserve?

153
00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:33.489
I mean…

154
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.576
A-ram. How many times
do I have to say this?

155
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:38.786
Please, think before you speak.

156
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.329
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.417
I'm not upset. Put your chin up.

158
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.918
Your little pup

159
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:47.753
is all grown up.

160
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:48.921
Come here.

161
00:09:54.093 --> 00:09:55.553
She was only this small.

162
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.198
I don't even know them.

163
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.952
No way. I'm not talking to them.

164
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.373
It's chaos.
They're just selling their names.

165
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.418
Twinkle.

166
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.670
No.

167
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.800
A-ram, I'm just an actor.
Why do I have to teach you this?

168
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.845
What is it that you--

169
00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.768
I'll call you back.

170
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:46.479
Twinkle. Let's go.

171
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.734
Need to do your business?

172
00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:55.905
Take your time.

173
00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:01.285
You okay?

174
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.418
-Hi, Ae-ra.
-What do think you're doing?

175
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.962
-What do you mean?
-A-ram told me everything.

176
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:14.924
Oh, you talked to him?

177
00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.968
It's nothing. Who'd do such a thing?

178
00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.888
You told him you won't do it?

179
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.431
-Why did…
-It is Cha In-pyo.

180
00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:25.434
-You got it wrong.
-No, I got it right.

181
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.312
Are you crazy? Why would I do that?

182
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:29.897
I'd never--

183
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.906
I was right!

184
00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:40.616
I told you it's Cha In-pyo!

185
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.535
Oh, my!

186
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.704
-Hello.
-My dear!

187
00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:47.832
Ae-ra, I'll call you back.

188
00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.875
Oh, my, Ae-ra?

189
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:52.253
Let me have that. I want to talk to her.

190
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.004
-It's not Ae-ra.
-Yes, it is.

191
00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:55.256
Hello…

192
00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:00.428
So, what are you doing here?

193
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.641
-I'm on a hike.
-I see.

194
00:12:08.602 --> 00:12:09.979
Then try this.

195
00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.859
No, thank you.

196
00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:16.944
It's good for you.

197
00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:19.280
Did you quit acting?

198
00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.073
What?

199
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:26.412
I've been working like crazy,
shooting dramas and films.

200
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:27.747
Really?

201
00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:31.333
That's strange. I haven't seen you lately.

202
00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.671
You should quit doing those small shows.

203
00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.716
Do AM Plaza or something.

204
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.676
Then we could all see you.

205
00:12:43.512 --> 00:12:45.848
Hey, can you do that thing you do?

206
00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:47.391
What?

207
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.477
You know what I'm talking about.

208
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.569
That was ages ago.
I'm not so young anymore.

209
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.115
That's okay. You still look fine.

210
00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:06.076
Come on, show me just one time.

211
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:08.621
Please stop.

212
00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:11.499
All My Love For You
was the best show ever.

213
00:13:11.582 --> 00:13:14.460
Make an appearance when you visit Korea.

214
00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:17.505
-Talk to you again, dear.
-Please give me the phone.

215
00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.967
-Take care.
-Bye.

216
00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:24.970
Honey.

217
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:27.598
Don't listen to him--

218
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.311
We're so lucky to see Cha In-pyo here.

219
00:13:32.853 --> 00:13:33.854
Excuse me.

220
00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:35.272
I'll call back.

221
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.109
Please give me that phone.

222
00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.946
Why? It's just a picture.

223
00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.282
-It's a good one.
-Please.

224
00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:48.828
DELETE?
YES

225
00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:51.705
I'll take a better one.

226
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.374
Oh, really?

227
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.213
-You're the best!
-Put your arm around me.

228
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.173
Wait just a moment.

229
00:14:03.634 --> 00:14:04.635
Oh, my.

230
00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.514
You're so nice.

231
00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:12.351
What a gentleman you are!

232
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.145
Thank you. Goodbye.

233
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.440
It's muddy after last night's rain.

234
00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.985
-Be careful on your hike.
-Okay, bye.

235
00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:25.114
He looks more handsome in person.

236
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:26.574
He does.

237
00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.868
I'm so glad we decided to hike here.

238
00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:42.464
-Do-cheol.
-In-pyo.

239
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:43.507
What's wrong?

240
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.343
I'm just a burden for you.

241
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:49.597
-What's up?
-I might not be in the film with you.

242
00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:52.641
-A-ram said that?
-Yes, he did.

243
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.561
Don't listen to his bullshit.
Just trust me.

244
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:57.771
Talk to you later.

245
00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:01.358
That kid never does what I tell him to.

246
00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:08.324
Twinkle?

247
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:13.871
Twinkle.

248
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:16.415
Twinkle.

249
00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:21.837
Twinkle!

250
00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:30.554
Twinkle.

251
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.182
Oh.

252
00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:37.519
-Is this your dog?
-Yes.

253
00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:40.481
-Thank you.
-No, there's a big mud puddle!

254
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.068
It's alright.

255
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:45.402
I can jump over it.

256
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:50.908
What's his problem?

257
00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.581
It's okay. I can get up myself.

258
00:15:58.082 --> 00:15:59.083
You're all muddy!

259
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.002
Twinkle.

260
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.170
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:04.755
Sorry.

262
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.839
Twinkle?

263
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:15.057
You thought I was your owner
because we're wearing the same clothes.

264
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.142
That's why you were following me.

265
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.019
Here.

266
00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:20.813
Wipe your face.

267
00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:23.023
Thank you.

268
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:29.238
Wait a second.

269
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:32.825
Do I know you?

270
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:35.661
Right, you're Cha In-pyo!

271
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:39.206
Seeing you in person
instead of on-screen is…

272
00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:42.167
well, not that impressive.

273
00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:45.754
Anyhow, nice to meet you.
Let's shake hands.

274
00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.590
My hand is dirty.

275
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.635
I can wash my hand later.

276
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.431
Come on. Don't be like that.

277
00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.729
Right, you can wash your hand.

278
00:17:03.272 --> 00:17:05.899
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

279
00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:08.235
Anyway,

280
00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:11.071
you really do look like a total mess.

281
00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:12.823
I know, right?

282
00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:16.368
Did you see the school
at the entrance of the trail?

283
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:19.580
The gym's shower room is always open.

284
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.165
Isn't that a girls' school?

285
00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.624
It's summer vacation.

286
00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.627
No one's there,
so you can use it to clean up.

287
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:29.798
Come on. Hurry up.

288
00:17:31.091 --> 00:17:32.384
It's Cha In-pyo!

289
00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.887
-Really, Cha In-pyo?
-Where?

290
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.014
Yes, hurry! It's him.

291
00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.072
Go.

292
00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:08.754
Where did he go?

293
00:18:08.837 --> 00:18:11.423
-Where is he?
-I didn't see him.

294
00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:12.841
Where'd he go?

295
00:18:27.564 --> 00:18:28.649
CHEONSEUNG GYM

296
00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:30.359
CONGRATULATIONS WINNING THE 22ND

297
00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.070
NATIONAL YOUTH THEATER FESTIVAL

298
00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:35.155
THEATER CLUB

299
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.299
Let's go get cleaned up.

300
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.885
Let's see where it is.

301
00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.444
That's not what I meant.

302
00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:57.613
Yeah, right. You meant it.

303
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.408
I told you to cast Do-cheol in my film.

304
00:20:01.491 --> 00:20:03.869
How hard can it be?
How can you let him down?

305
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.079
Why did you do that?

306
00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:10.250
We're planning to demolish this building.

307
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.501
Oh my gosh.

308
00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.670
That's not for me to decide.

309
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.047
But it's not safe.

310
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.258
The gas pipeline is from here and there.

311
00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:20.344
-Yes.
-So this position will--

312
00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:23.222
Forget it. I wouldn't understand anyway.

313
00:20:23.305 --> 00:20:26.058
You're saying
we should dig out the whole floor here?

314
00:20:26.141 --> 00:20:29.728
That's not realistic, so I'll replace
the pressure unit tomorrow.

315
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.273
Girls from the theater club
practice here in the summer.

316
00:20:33.357 --> 00:20:34.483
How long will it take?

317
00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.151
Just one and a half days.

318
00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:37.486
-You sure?
-Yes.

319
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.988
What are you sorry for again?

320
00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:41.823
I'm asking why you did that.

321
00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.784
Stop apologizing.

322
00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:44.743
In-pyo.

323
00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:47.579
I have an incoming call.

324
00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.165
I'm talking to you now.
What's more important?

325
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.792
It's the variety show writer.

326
00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:53.043
Answer it right now.

327
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:58.465
The pressure may cause an explosion,
so make sure the water is shut off.

328
00:20:58.548 --> 00:21:00.550
Let's fix the highest risks first.

329
00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:04.554
Twinkle, wait here.

330
00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.432
I'll be back soon.

331
00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.986
PUT THINGS BACK WHERE THEY BELONG!

332
00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:25.075
In-pyo, the writer just told me

333
00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:29.288
they decided to put you
on the show list for now.

334
00:21:29.997 --> 00:21:33.250
What does she mean "for now"?

335
00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:37.713
For now, it'll be Song Kang-ho,
Sol Kyung-gu, and Lee Byung-hun.

336
00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.757
They might just go
with the "Three Great Stars."

337
00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:42.718
Without Kyung-gu?

338
00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.804
-No.
-Without Byung-hun?

339
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.473
They'd never leave out Song Kang-ho.

340
00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:50.892
You're available
tomorrow afternoon, right?

341
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:51.935
Yes.

342
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:54.187
Okay, then I'll confirm with her.

343
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:56.023
It's a talk show, so it'll be easy.

344
00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:00.569
That's freezing!

345
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:11.246
Four Great Stars.

346
00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:36.229
Wash, wash all the way
You won't lose any hair

347
00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:38.523
Wash, wash all the way

348
00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:46.740
In-pyo, please show us.

349
00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:48.658
Sure.

350
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.536
It's been ages, but…

351
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.373
Come on, it's totally your thing.

352
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:58.710
Shall I?

353
00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:03.840
Oh, my eyes.

354
00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.515
MANAGER A-RAM

355
00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:14.184
-Yes?
-Bad news.

356
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.062
-What's up?
-Tomorrow is canceled.

357
00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:19.856
She said she'll call to reschedule.

358
00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:22.692
Why?

359
00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:28.115
Byung-hun is on an overseas shoot,
but his return flight got canceled.

360
00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:31.952
Can't we just go as a trio?

361
00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:34.704
He needs to learn how to be more punctual.

362
00:23:36.623 --> 00:23:38.625
I don't think that's a good idea.

363
00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:43.422
A-ram.

364
00:23:44.047 --> 00:23:46.758
Isn't stepping on shit
a sign of good luck?

365
00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:48.927
Usually.

366
00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:52.347
What if I grabbed it tightly?

367
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:55.475
-What would that mean?
-You hit the jackpot.

368
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:58.103
Luck is in your hand. Was it a dream?

369
00:23:58.186 --> 00:23:59.938
Never mind.

370
00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:02.023
Keep me updated.

371
00:24:02.482 --> 00:24:03.984
Okay, get some rest.

372
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.864
Twinkle, I'll be right there.

373
00:24:13.201 --> 00:24:15.996
Yes, Mr. Principal. It's Kim.

374
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:19.374
You better get over
to the school right away. Please hurry!

375
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:22.711
Why is this happening on my shift?

376
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:29.593
I said no pictures.

377
00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:30.760
It's not a TV show--

378
00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:32.137
Hey, what are you doing?

379
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.389
-What outlet are you from?
-Kyo-won Paper.

380
00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:36.892
Was the building inspected?

381
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:40.479
It was scheduled to be rebuilt anyway.

382
00:24:40.562 --> 00:24:42.397
We were about to demolish it.

383
00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:45.984
No one got hurt or killed.

384
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.570
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:49.654
Let go!

386
00:24:51.031 --> 00:24:52.032
Yes, sir.

387
00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:57.746
We had everything under control
before it collapsed, right?

388
00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:58.914
Of course!

389
00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:03.418
The entrance was chained shut,
and I made sure no one got in.

390
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.587
I also told the theater club not to come

391
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.547
since the construction is tomorrow.

392
00:25:08.131 --> 00:25:11.218
You hear that?
Everything was under control.

393
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.762
We deserve an award for exemplary work.

394
00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:23.980
The insurance company is coming tomorrow.

395
00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:27.150
No one goes in until they're done.

396
00:25:27.234 --> 00:25:28.860
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

397
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.531
Hello? Yes, sir.

398
00:25:32.614 --> 00:25:35.408
I'll stay here all night.
Don't worry, sir!

399
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:40.664
Hey! Don't touch that!

400
00:25:40.747 --> 00:25:42.290
Get down right now!

401
00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.085
What do cops
know about this sort of thing?

402
00:25:45.168 --> 00:25:46.211
Come on down!

403
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:49.464
We're up here for a reason.

404
00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:50.840
We're on duty.

405
00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:52.884
Who are you to tell us what to do?

406
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:55.262
I'm on duty, too!

407
00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:59.349
And I'm telling you what to do
because it's my job!

408
00:25:59.432 --> 00:26:02.018
Stop contaminating the scene
and come down already!

409
00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:04.729
The experts will be doing
an inspection tomorrow.

410
00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.106
So get down!

411
00:26:06.856 --> 00:26:07.899
Chief?

412
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.427
Four Great Stars…

413
00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:16.718
Where am I?

414
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:28.271
Hello! Is anyone there?

415
00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.815
Is anyone out there?

416
00:27:38.448 --> 00:27:42.243
I'm down here! Hello?

417
00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:18.822
I knew it would collapse someday.

418
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.281
We got out just in time.

419
00:28:21.157 --> 00:28:22.951
That's for sure.

420
00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:24.744
So, why'd you call me here?

421
00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:27.497
The insurance guys are coming.

422
00:28:28.081 --> 00:28:29.290
You gotta talk to them.

423
00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:33.086
It collapsed right after your visit.

424
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.338
I don't have anything to say.

425
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:38.633
Well, we'll see about that.

426
00:28:42.804 --> 00:28:44.514
We'll see who's responsible.

427
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:16.713
What the hell--?

428
00:30:17.106 --> 00:30:19.192
Hey! Get down from there!

429
00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:22.612
The principal will freak out
if he sees you up there.

430
00:30:22.695 --> 00:30:25.949
Look. I came to replace
the pressure unit yesterday.

431
00:30:26.032 --> 00:30:29.410
It wouldn't look like this
if the pump had exploded.

432
00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:31.287
The pipe would be blown to bits!

433
00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:32.956
Come on.

434
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.291
I'm not accusing you.

435
00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:37.877
Just let go. Come on.

436
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.671
How was it positioned?

437
00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:41.214
Like this?

438
00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:44.217
-But I--
-Don't touch anything!

439
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.802
Just get out of here.

440
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.805
I said get out!

441
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:54.227
Hello?

442
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.895
CHEONSEUNG HIGH SCHOOL

443
00:31:15.164 --> 00:31:17.458
I told you to stay out of there!

444
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:20.044
You're ignoring my orders?

445
00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:22.714
You heard him!

446
00:31:22.797 --> 00:31:24.549
-I still need to check--
-Come on!

447
00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.889
I told you to stay out!
Was I not clear about that?

448
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.974
What the hell are they doing?

449
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:39.439
One, two…

450
00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:50.241
Wait…

451
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.330
Think straight.

452
00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.999
I need to think rationally.

453
00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.463
My clothes.

454
00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:05.298
Shocking news. Cha In-pyo is…

455
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:07.133
SUPERSTAR CHA IN-PYO RESCUED!

456
00:32:07.216 --> 00:32:09.135
Cha In-pyo! Why were you there?

457
00:32:09.218 --> 00:32:10.678
IN-PYO FOUND NAKED!

458
00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.263
IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HIS BODY!

459
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:14.349
-No pictures!
-Were you after school girls?

460
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:17.143
I'm not Cha In-pyo! I'm not!

461
00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:29.989
Damn it.

462
00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:32.575
This sucks.

463
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:36.204
The pipe.

464
00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:27.046
Call.

465
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.965
Call…

466
00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:29.882
Kim A-ram.

467
00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.217
Manager.

468
00:33:32.051 --> 00:33:33.011
Mana--

469
00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:40.768
It's the gas pressure.

470
00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:42.854
See how this area is burnt?

471
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:45.398
The wall was already unstable,

472
00:33:45.481 --> 00:33:47.608
so it collapsed when the gas pipe blew.

473
00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:49.485
What are you talking about?

474
00:33:50.403 --> 00:33:53.281
Some other equipment could've exploded.

475
00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.407
I don't think so.

476
00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:58.161
No one else was in the gym yesterday.

477
00:33:58.244 --> 00:34:00.663
Sir, please don't get us wrong.

478
00:34:00.747 --> 00:34:02.331
We're not saying it's your fault.

479
00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:06.044
Everything was poorly built
during the 1987 building material crisis.

480
00:34:06.961 --> 00:34:09.130
I've seen
a lot of buildings like this.

481
00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:11.924
Whatever exploded,

482
00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:15.928
it was probably caused
by a recent inspection.

483
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:19.807
It looks like the floor
was ripped up to check the pipeline.

484
00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:22.685
Even a tiny jolt can do major damage.

485
00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.064
-Take pictures of this.
-Okay.

486
00:34:26.647 --> 00:34:30.526
I don't think I did anything wrong.

487
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.779
The gas pressure regulator.

488
00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.091
What's wrong?
I've been calling you like crazy.

489
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.967
Where are you? I'm up shit's creek.

490
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:57.220
Good!
At least you know you're in trouble.

491
00:34:57.303 --> 00:35:00.348
-I said, where are you?
-The TV station.

492
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:03.392
Just shut up and get here ASAP.

493
00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:06.104
He says he can't come. Wanna talk to him?

494
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:09.524
Hello? A-ram, you there?

495
00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.275
Hold on, she's coming.

496
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:13.069
-Here she is.
-No, don't.

497
00:35:13.152 --> 00:35:16.114
I couldn't reach you
for the rehearsal interview,

498
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.406
so I came instead.

499
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.575
Don't put her on the phone.

500
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.868
Hello, In-pyo.

501
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:25.248
It's been a while. How have you been?

502
00:35:25.873 --> 00:35:28.793
Oh, hi. How have you been?

503
00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:32.964
I'm sorry to change
the schedule at the last minute.

504
00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.633
I understand. It's part of the job.

505
00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:38.344
I'm sorry, but can I talk to my manager?

506
00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:39.971
He went to the restroom.

507
00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:44.392
You know them personally, right?

508
00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:46.853
Are you uncomfortable with--

509
00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:50.898
No, we're all friends, like brothers.

510
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:54.694
Both Kyung-gu and Byung-hun
have good energy.

511
00:35:55.444 --> 00:35:58.865
Do you have any recent anecdotes
involving them?

512
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.452
Recent?

513
00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:05.288
Yes, recent.

514
00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.790
I might have some.

515
00:36:07.874 --> 00:36:11.085
Really? Your manager said
you only work out in your free time

516
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:14.213
and was worried
you didn't have any fun stories to share.

517
00:36:14.297 --> 00:36:17.925
He said you work out,
eat chicken breast, and repeat.

518
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.135
Right…

519
00:36:20.428 --> 00:36:24.640
Do you have any talents
you'd like to showcase?

520
00:36:24.724 --> 00:36:27.351
-You don't have to.
-Talents?

521
00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:30.646
The other guests have some,

522
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.106
so we have enough to air.

523
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.816
But in case you have any…

524
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.902
Yes, of course.

525
00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:40.156
I have that gesture I'm famous for.

526
00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:42.533
A famous gesture?

527
00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:50.249
Oh, right. That…

528
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.792
Yeah, that'll knock 'em dead.

529
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.545
I can't let it die.

530
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.714
-Do you have anything else?
-What?

531
00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:59.592
Never mind. I'll see you at the shoot.

532
00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.970
Okay. Have a great day.

533
00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:04.847
It's me, A-ram.

534
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:06.974
-A-ram.
-Yes, sir.

535
00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:07.934
Get over here.

536
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:09.602
We're done here.

537
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.354
Have a good one.

538
00:37:17.526 --> 00:37:19.528
Why are they leaving already?

539
00:37:19.612 --> 00:37:22.281
-Wait. Come back!
-Hey!

540
00:37:22.365 --> 00:37:25.243
It was scheduled for demolition anyway.

541
00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:27.036
Don't worry about it.

542
00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:30.748
But you're pinning the blame on me.

543
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:34.252
It's just a formality. You know how it is.

544
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:38.172
And you won't have to pay!
The insurance will cover it.

545
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:39.340
So don't worry!

546
00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:42.343
But the inspection
shouldn't be so half-assed.

547
00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:45.346
Listen, young man.
I'm trying my best here.

548
00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.681
Don't call it half-assed!

549
00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:49.642
You wanna do things by the book?

550
00:37:50.142 --> 00:37:51.978
You wanna get arrested?

551
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.105
Should I call the police?

552
00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:57.233
Arrested? What I meant was--

553
00:37:57.316 --> 00:37:59.235
Enough already!

554
00:37:59.318 --> 00:38:00.611
Enough!

555
00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:04.115
Get out of here!

556
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:11.914
You're leaving?

557
00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:17.795
The demolition crew will be here soon.

558
00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:19.463
-Okay, good work.
-Thanks!

559
00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:23.801
Take care, sir.

560
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:32.268
Why are you in there butt naked?

561
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:35.354
Do you take showers
with your clothes on?

562
00:38:35.438 --> 00:38:40.234
You could've taken a shower at home.
Why'd you have to do it there?

563
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:43.279
I was covered in mud.
I can't walk around like that.

564
00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:46.073
I'll call for help right now.

565
00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.700
No! Are you crazy?

566
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.454
Just come over here and get me out.

567
00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:53.664
Who cares if people see you naked?

568
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:56.959
Who cares?
What kind of manager says that?

569
00:38:57.585 --> 00:39:00.004
It's not more important than your life.

570
00:39:00.087 --> 00:39:01.088
I already told you.

571
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.132
I'm not even hurt.

572
00:39:03.215 --> 00:39:06.052
I just need you
to come get me out of here.

573
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:10.097
-Fine, I'm almost there.
-What are you not getting?

574
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:12.099
Are you really my manager?

575
00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.142
In-pyo.

576
00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:18.314
Are you really in there?

577
00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:19.940
What do you mean?

578
00:39:24.904 --> 00:39:27.114
I'll call you back.

579
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.159
Wait, don't hang up. Please!

580
00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:44.256
What the--?

581
00:39:45.674 --> 00:39:46.675
Whose is this?

582
00:39:48.302 --> 00:39:49.428
A celebrity's car?

583
00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:52.306
What's that excavator doing?

584
00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:56.102
Isn't it obvious?
It's demolishing what's left.

585
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:58.604
Oh, no.

586
00:39:59.688 --> 00:40:01.690
Wait! Stop!

587
00:40:01.774 --> 00:40:04.527
-Stop!
-What are you doing?

588
00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.155
-Let go!
-You'll get yourself killed!

589
00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.199
What's wrong with you? Talk to me!

590
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.203
-Stop!
-Hey, come back here!

591
00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:24.255
Don't do that! Stop!

592
00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:28.050
What the hell! Are you insane?

593
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.392
What on earth is going on out there?

594
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:39.979
Wait, calm down.

595
00:40:40.563 --> 00:40:42.898
Go ahead, tell us.

596
00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:45.776
Why can't we finish the job?

597
00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:50.072
-Actually…
-Actually what?

598
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:55.619
He'd like to donate after seeing the news.

599
00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:59.373
What news? The Kyo-won was
the only paper that took pictures of this.

600
00:40:59.999 --> 00:41:02.168
Right, that newspaper.

601
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:04.044
It's a monthly.

602
00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:05.629
It's already out?

603
00:41:10.176 --> 00:41:11.677
It just came out today.

604
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.975
But it's for teachers.

605
00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:22.396
Are you a teacher or something?

606
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.488
Actually…

607
00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.407
I'm Cha In-pyo's manager.

608
00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:34.575
Cha In-pyo?

609
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:40.247
That guy who does all the good deeds?
You know, he does that thing.

610
00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.666
Of course, I know.

611
00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:45.503
Right?

612
00:41:46.295 --> 00:41:50.424
That explains the fancy car
and tinted windows.

613
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:54.011
But why would he donate to this place?

614
00:41:54.094 --> 00:41:55.888
Maybe he went to school here.

615
00:41:56.931 --> 00:41:58.974
Yes, he has such fond memories.

616
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:01.143
When he heard the gym collapsed--

617
00:42:01.227 --> 00:42:02.311
It's a girls' school.

618
00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:07.983
He went to a girls' school?

619
00:42:17.826 --> 00:42:18.702
No…

620
00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:20.996
His wife, Shin Ae-ra.

621
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:25.084
That's a relief.

622
00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:26.794
Wait, no way.

623
00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.880
She went to school with my sister-in-law.

624
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:31.757
Shall I check?

625
00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:34.301
Wait, no need for that.

626
00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.845
Then tell us what's going on!

627
00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.975
Cha In-pyo would like to
come here tomorrow

628
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:44.019
and see the disaster site
before it's cleaned up.

629
00:42:44.103 --> 00:42:45.396
That's why I stopped you.

630
00:42:45.479 --> 00:42:47.606
Okay, so far, so good.

631
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:51.694
And he's really interested in education.

632
00:42:51.777 --> 00:42:53.153
Really interested?

633
00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:57.324
-And most importantly…
-Most importantly?

634
00:42:58.367 --> 00:43:00.703
Su-jeong! No!

635
00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:03.372
Isn't that Jeong-eun
from the theater club?

636
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.376
Mr. Kim! It's Su-jeong!

637
00:43:07.459 --> 00:43:09.169
What? What's wrong with her?

638
00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:14.216
Look. Do you see that?

639
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.510
That crazy pervert was here again!

640
00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.473
Isn't that…?

641
00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:23.350
As it breaks down,

642
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:28.814
semen turns watery an average
of one to two minutes after ejaculation.

643
00:43:28.897 --> 00:43:30.149
It's not watery yet.

644
00:43:31.525 --> 00:43:33.319
He's still around!

645
00:43:37.906 --> 00:43:38.949
What's this?

646
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.910
So she went in to install a camera

647
00:43:41.994 --> 00:43:43.996
to catch the pervert?

648
00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:50.502
Her mom is going crazy
after she didn't come home last night.

649
00:43:51.003 --> 00:43:54.048
Her brother said she borrowed money
from him to buy a camera.

650
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:56.550
What is wrong with you girls?

651
00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.803
Why would you put a camera
in a shower room?

652
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:02.348
How can you even shower in there?

653
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:04.058
That's not what matters now!

654
00:44:04.141 --> 00:44:06.935
Su-jeong might be in there!

655
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:10.272
No way. I locked the entrance last night.

656
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.983
No one could've gotten in.

657
00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.778
Will you be responsible if she's in there?

658
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:17.363
-Me?
-Mister.

659
00:44:17.446 --> 00:44:20.783
Come on, a young girl is in there.
Call 911 now!

660
00:44:20.866 --> 00:44:23.911
Yes, right.
Let's call them. I'll make the call.

661
00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.704
Go move that thing!

662
00:44:25.788 --> 00:44:27.414
I'll call now, sweetie.

663
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.710
Get ready to be rescued.

664
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.504
You're here already?

665
00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:37.091
-A rescue team is on its way.
-You called 911? Are you crazy?

666
00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.385
Why did you do that?

667
00:44:40.427 --> 00:44:42.596
-Do what?
-I can't believe you did that.

668
00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.056
What did I do?

669
00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:47.518
Did you wear
that workout outfit for the ads?

670
00:44:47.601 --> 00:44:49.061
Yeah, so what?

671
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.191
Let's be honest with each other.

672
00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:02.783
If you told me why you were here,
or why I shouldn't let people know,

673
00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:05.077
it would've been easier.

674
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.455
You're driving me nuts.
What are you even talking about?

675
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:14.545
Is that an ambulance?

676
00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:16.380
Shut this down now!

677
00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:17.756
No can do.

678
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.969
A student went missing
while trying to catch you here.

679
00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.220
Catch me?

680
00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.389
Why?

681
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:30.310
-Is everything okay?
-Right there! Go.

682
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.771
Oh my gosh.

683
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:38.777
They have to pick through
the rubble by hand.

684
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:42.406
This would've gone badly
if you hadn't stopped us.

685
00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:48.036
Right, Cha In-pyo read
a social media post about her story.

686
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.913
So he sent me here.

687
00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:53.459
-Was that the story?
-Yes.

688
00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:57.838
She wanted to fight for justice
through the camera lens.

689
00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:58.839
Amazing.

690
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:04.261
His fans are so special,
unlike anything I've ever seen.

691
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.974
-Get the floorplans!
-Yes, Captain.

692
00:46:09.558 --> 00:46:11.143
We need the gym's floorplans.

693
00:46:11.226 --> 00:46:13.020
I know where they are.

694
00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:15.522
Then go get them. Now!

695
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.024
-Run!
-I'm on it!

696
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:20.068
Hurry it up! Run!

697
00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:21.737
Hurry!

698
00:46:22.654 --> 00:46:24.823
Everyone, step back, please.

699
00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:28.994
Can't you run any faster?

700
00:46:33.373 --> 00:46:34.958
What did I do wrong?

701
00:46:39.046 --> 00:46:42.216
This is the worst time to be hungry.

702
00:46:45.677 --> 00:46:46.804
How can I be hungry?

703
00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:49.348
At a time like this? Crazy bastard!

704
00:47:20.462 --> 00:47:23.507
You haven't shut the valve yet?
Close it already.

705
00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.092
I forgot.

706
00:47:25.801 --> 00:47:27.177
Okay, now it's shut.

707
00:47:35.143 --> 00:47:36.061
You have any water?

708
00:47:36.144 --> 00:47:38.063
It suddenly stopped.

709
00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:39.773
How can you drink water now?

710
00:47:40.315 --> 00:47:42.317
I can't. It stopped running.

711
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:45.070
There aren't any students near you?

712
00:47:45.946 --> 00:47:48.198
I told you, I'm all alone.

713
00:47:48.782 --> 00:47:50.659
I'll check around and call back.

714
00:47:53.579 --> 00:47:57.666
If he gets caught, no more ads,
not even the new ones.

715
00:47:57.749 --> 00:47:59.960
A-ram, pull yourself together.

716
00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:05.716
Are you okay?

717
00:48:06.675 --> 00:48:07.926
Yes, I'm fine.

718
00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:12.639
The shower room is about 26 feet
from the main entrance

719
00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.349
in a semi-basement structure.

720
00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:16.602
It should be right there.

721
00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.228
There?

722
00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:19.688
Yes, sir.

723
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.647
Are you sure?

724
00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.941
Team 1, window side.
Team 2, the shower room.

725
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:24.526
-Now, move!
-Yes, sir!

726
00:48:27.112 --> 00:48:29.114
-Careful!
-Yes, sir!

727
00:48:33.619 --> 00:48:36.288
-Careful!
-Yes, sir!

728
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.459
Lord, please don't worry about me now.

729
00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:43.420
Please let them find the girl first.

730
00:48:44.922 --> 00:48:47.549
I say this with utmost sincerity.

731
00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.011
Please find her first

732
00:48:51.803 --> 00:48:52.930
instead of me.

733
00:48:56.725 --> 00:49:00.020
Can you tell if anyone is down there?

734
00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:02.064
We need to dig more.

735
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.653
I see something here!

736
00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.237
What is it?

737
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:11.782
-I think we found someone!
-What?

738
00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:13.909
Really?

739
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.079
Please stay back!

740
00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:18.830
Please step back.

741
00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:20.040
Su-jeong?

742
00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:22.084
Su-jeong!

743
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.882
I'm seeing lots of skin.
It's like they're naked!

744
00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:34.846
Su-jeong!

745
00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:37.975
No, you can't go in there.

746
00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:40.769
-Su-jeong!
-She'll be fine.

747
00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:44.606
Don't rush. Be extra careful!

748
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.234
I don't see any movement.

749
00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:49.653
Bring a stretcher!

750
00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:53.490
Wait!

751
00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:55.450
Su-jeong is calling me.

752
00:49:55.534 --> 00:49:57.911
Halt! There's a call!

753
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.248
Are you okay? Can you hear us?

754
00:50:05.585 --> 00:50:07.838
Yes, Mr. Principal. You're almost here?

755
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.172
Well?

756
00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:10.841
What did she say?

757
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.052
I'm so sorry. She's home now.

758
00:50:14.553 --> 00:50:16.930
She was at an internet cafe!

759
00:50:17.806 --> 00:50:20.267
Then who were you rescuing?

760
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.227
Get them out, quick!

761
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.646
That's it! Pull harder!

762
00:50:30.318 --> 00:50:31.153
It's…

763
00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.531
It's…

764
00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:35.866
We saved this!

765
00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.868
We rescued this!

766
00:50:37.951 --> 00:50:39.870
Come on!

767
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.917
No need to come.

768
00:50:47.919 --> 00:50:49.129
You're already here.

769
00:51:09.274 --> 00:51:10.233
In-pyo.

770
00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:12.069
They're wrapping up.

771
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:15.614
See? I prayed
with all my heart, and it worked.

772
00:51:16.448 --> 00:51:17.783
What should I do now?

773
00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:21.620
Wait until everyone is gone,
then get me out.

774
00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.416
You're not leaving?

775
00:51:28.126 --> 00:51:30.545
When are you leaving?

776
00:51:31.171 --> 00:51:34.716
I can't leave. I have to monitor
the demolishing progress.

777
00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:39.054
We have to finish
as much as we can before it gets dark.

778
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:49.314
Now what's going on?

779
00:52:01.118 --> 00:52:04.454
-Gimme an update.
-Thanks. I got the call!

780
00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:08.959
-Who is this?
-It's Do-cheol.

781
00:52:09.417 --> 00:52:12.003
Oh, hey. What call?

782
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:15.257
I got an audition call for that film.

783
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.424
Good.

784
00:52:16.925 --> 00:52:20.011
I told you they'd call.
Just have faith and patience.

785
00:52:20.595 --> 00:52:22.097
The number you have dialed…

786
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:26.226
I thought it was over for me.

787
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:29.229
What do you mean "over"?

788
00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:32.649
Nothing's over till the moment you die.

789
00:52:32.732 --> 00:52:33.942
I'll keep that in mind.

790
00:52:34.526 --> 00:52:37.904
Do-cheol, I can't talk right now.

791
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.868
I'll call back.
Good luck with the audition.

792
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:44.411
We can do it!

793
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:45.579
Yes, we can!

794
00:52:46.204 --> 00:52:47.581
What's going on?

795
00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.220
Who were you talking--

796
00:53:04.055 --> 00:53:05.974
Sorry. Mr. Park, the reporter?

797
00:53:06.057 --> 00:53:08.435
Answer your phone!

798
00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:10.145
In-pyo?

799
00:53:10.645 --> 00:53:13.690
He's out of town on a film shoot.

800
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.946
Twinkle?

801
00:53:21.907 --> 00:53:23.200
No, Twinkle.

802
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:24.826
Stay back. It's dangerous.

803
00:53:26.494 --> 00:53:27.495
Twinkle.

804
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.956
Are you all right?

805
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:33.710
It's scary, huh?
I'm okay. Are you?

806
00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:35.795
What's that kid doing?

807
00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.464
No, that can't be true.

808
00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:41.009
I'll check with him
and call you right back.

809
00:53:41.468 --> 00:53:42.719
Sure, okay.

810
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:49.768
Hello?

811
00:53:49.851 --> 00:53:53.521
Hi, Mr. Jo.
Sorry, no time for reporters right now.

812
00:53:53.605 --> 00:53:55.357
I'll call you back later.

813
00:53:59.486 --> 00:54:01.404
No, not over there!

814
00:54:01.488 --> 00:54:02.530
No!

815
00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:03.949
Wait!

816
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:08.578
Are you insane?

817
00:54:11.164 --> 00:54:11.998
What now?

818
00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:17.003
Well, down there-- There's…

819
00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.380
There's what?

820
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:23.301
What I mean is…

821
00:54:23.969 --> 00:54:27.097
I think that when I got here…

822
00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.725
I think I lost my ring.

823
00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:34.854
I'm sure it's around here somewhere.

824
00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:38.316
I'm sure I'll find it before long.

825
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.319
Why don't you work on
another area for now?

826
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:43.738
Wow, you're really something.

827
00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:45.198
Hurry up.

828
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:48.410
This sucks.

829
00:54:57.294 --> 00:55:00.547
Were you scared, too? You hungry?

830
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.883
Let's have something good to eat
when we get out of here.

831
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.263
In-pyo. Are you okay?

832
00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:10.724
Yes, and I just found Twinkle.

833
00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.350
Twinkle? Who's that?

834
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:15.020
How can you not know my Twinkle?

835
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.732
Oh, that little dog?
That's not important now.

836
00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:21.568
-Reporters are calling me like crazy.
-What did you say?

837
00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:24.154
The net is exploding
with comments about you.

838
00:55:24.237 --> 00:55:25.572
No, before that.

839
00:55:25.655 --> 00:55:27.282
What did you say about Twinkle?

840
00:55:27.365 --> 00:55:28.908
What did I say?

841
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:32.037
-That's not important right now…
-Stop.

842
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.873
Even if she's a dog,
you can't treat Twinkle like that.

843
00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.209
Twinkle is my family.

844
00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:40.837
Is she okay?

845
00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.297
You totally don't mean it.

846
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.299
You thought I wouldn't notice?

847
00:55:44.382 --> 00:55:46.343
-That's not--
-No excuses.

848
00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:49.596
If you saw the world sincerely
with all your heart,

849
00:55:49.679 --> 00:55:51.348
you wouldn't talk like that.

850
00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:52.515
I'm sorry.

851
00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:56.061
I'm not mad at you.

852
00:55:56.144 --> 00:55:58.104
I'm not saying this for an apology.

853
00:55:58.897 --> 00:56:02.233
I try not to say I'm sorry,
but I can't stop.

854
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:03.943
I apologize.

855
00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:07.447
A-ram. I'm telling you this
for your own good.

856
00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:10.992
Right, I'll keep that in mind.

857
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.621
So what's the problem?

858
00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:17.290
Hey, did you find your ring?

859
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:20.126
No, not yet. Wait there.

860
00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:22.545
Here, eat this.

861
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.340
Did you lose your ring?

862
00:56:26.091 --> 00:56:27.384
Where?

863
00:56:28.468 --> 00:56:29.594
I knew that'd happen.

864
00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:31.429
-You should be more careful.
-Yeah.

865
00:56:31.513 --> 00:56:32.430
Hello?

866
00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:34.682
It's around here?

867
00:56:34.766 --> 00:56:35.642
A-ram.

868
00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:37.394
It's not here?

869
00:56:37.477 --> 00:56:39.270
I might have lost it over there.

870
00:56:39.354 --> 00:56:42.023
How did you lose it?

871
00:56:42.107 --> 00:56:45.276
It's too small to find here.

872
00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.153
I'll find it myself.

873
00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:48.613
Come on.

874
00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.034
Is this it?

875
00:56:57.288 --> 00:56:58.289
I guess not.

876
00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:15.849
Did someone sneeze down there?

877
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:21.771
Don't be silly. There's no one there.

878
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.150
You didn't hear that?

879
00:57:26.401 --> 00:57:28.153
I heard something down there.

880
00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:31.197
I just--

881
00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:34.826
It's so dusty here.

882
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:35.910
No!

883
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.831
I know where it came from.

884
00:57:41.708 --> 00:57:42.750
Come here.

885
00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:49.215
Why go to all this trouble?

886
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.759
I really heard something.

887
00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:53.303
I gotta check it out!

888
00:57:54.596 --> 00:57:59.934
If they were conscious and able to sneeze,

889
00:58:00.018 --> 00:58:04.314
wouldn't they be screaming for help?

890
00:58:05.607 --> 00:58:08.151
You think so? But--

891
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:12.197
Please help find my ring.

892
00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.495
-Mister.
-That's so weird.

893
00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:22.332
I paid a million won
for those rings my girlfriend and I wore.

894
00:58:22.415 --> 00:58:25.835
But we still broke up.

895
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.546
Hey! Anybody down there?

896
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:32.133
If so, make a noise!

897
00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:33.551
Hey!

898
00:58:35.094 --> 00:58:36.930
I should let it go, right?

899
00:58:43.603 --> 00:58:46.439
Whoever finds it should keep it.

900
00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:47.774
That makes sense, right?

901
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:51.736
What kind of loser wears a ring
he got with an ex-girlfriend?

902
00:58:51.819 --> 00:58:52.904
A loser?

903
00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:57.492
Don't belittle yourself like that.

904
00:59:00.286 --> 00:59:03.414
You may have lost your ring,

905
00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:08.253
but your soul has been restored

906
00:59:09.629 --> 00:59:11.256
and is freer than ever.

907
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:18.054
Do you still hear something underground?

908
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:23.059
-Shall we look into it together?
-No.

909
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:27.897
No, stay right there.
I'm probably hearing things.

910
00:59:27.981 --> 00:59:31.734
I've been hearing strange sounds lately.

911
00:59:31.818 --> 00:59:33.653
And my eyes keep twitching.

912
00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.155
Right? Who'd be down there?

913
00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.992
Yeah! I keep hearing things.

914
00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.618
Just stay where you are.

915
00:59:42.036 --> 00:59:45.665
Mister, let's take a break.
Do you want another snack?

916
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:54.507
In-pyo. I took care of it.

917
00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:59.971
Wow, that was close. You little monkey.

918
01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.145
So, what were you talking about?

919
01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:10.231
There's a rumor about you online.

920
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.191
What rumor?

921
01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.028
Do they know I'm trapped down here?

922
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.904
No, it's about the nomination.

923
01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:20.158
They're saying
you'll run in the special election.

924
01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.200
Me?

925
01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.536
They say a new candidate will be announced

926
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.372
after the ruling party registers theirs.

927
01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:30.335
That candidate is you.
It says you already had a meeting.

928
01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.337
What the…?

929
01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.839
So what do the people say?

930
01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:37.091
What people?

931
01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:42.221
If there's an article, there are comments.

932
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.806
Oh, right.

933
01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.144
-"Totally disgusted."
-What?

934
01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:52.023
"That bastard is a backstabber."

935
01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:56.861
"He thinks he's a politician
because he played one."

936
01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:58.446
And…

937
01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.574
Never mind.

938
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.659
What?

939
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.661
Just say it.

940
01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:08.039
"I knew he'd do it
after that volunteer work."

941
01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:09.624
"Fucking scumbag."

942
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.215
No supportive comments?

943
01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.009
Of course there are.

944
01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.221
"In-pyo, cheer up! I live in unit 601."

945
01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:27.183
"Thanks for the closets you left
when you moved out."

946
01:01:27.266 --> 01:01:29.394
"I don't have the service number."

947
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:32.438
"If you're reading this, please reply."

948
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:35.066
Do you know her? Should I read more?

949
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.776
No.

950
01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.197
In-pyo.

951
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.950
You're not really doing it, are you?

952
01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:47.161
I've told you many times.
I don't want my name used like that.

953
01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.247
Did you make it clear to them?

954
01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.332
I was crystal clear.

955
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.793
You only do something
if your heart is in it.

956
01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:55.670
And?

957
01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.841
I asked them
to help you keep it that way.

958
01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.009
Is that all?

959
01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.971
Yeah. The assemblyman said he understood.

960
01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.642
A-ram!

961
01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.519
Are you testing my patience?

962
01:02:11.602 --> 01:02:14.105
Why would you say it like that?

963
01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:15.815
I'm sorry.

964
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.359
Stop saying sorry. Why did you do that?

965
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.611
Schedule a press conference.

966
01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:24.031
I'll put my foot down
and show them I mean business.

967
01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:24.949
Okay.

968
01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:26.909
I'll go book a conference room.

969
01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.871
They're really testing my patience.

970
01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:32.457
You need to get out of there first.

971
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.459
You should come out now.

972
01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:37.086
I'll explain it to the people here.

973
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.380
How will you explain it?

974
01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:44.010
-We should respect sexual preferences.
-I'm gonna kill you.

975
01:02:45.303 --> 01:02:48.139
Hey, you need to do something.

976
01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:51.684
I'm out of excuses.
They'll think I'm insane.

977
01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:53.352
-Just come out!
-Hold on.

978
01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:55.730
Hurry up!

979
01:02:58.399 --> 01:03:00.902
Be quiet! I'm thinking!

980
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.247
I must find it.

981
01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:20.505
There must be a solution.

982
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.930
Don't panic.
Let's focus and figure this out.

983
01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:34.268
Everything exists for a reason.

984
01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.688
What's my reason?

985
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.941
And…

986
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.193
what's yours?

987
01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.530
Got it!

988
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:47.782
There's a way.

989
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.993
We don't have much time!
It's now or never!

990
01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.078
Fine.

991
01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:55.665
Let me put on
some underwear at least. Hold on.

992
01:03:58.376 --> 01:03:59.460
She's the right size.

993
01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:03.714
Twinkle.

994
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.591
Time to change.

995
01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.265
What was that?

996
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.103
Twinkle?

997
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.688
Twinkle.

998
01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:21.858
No, come here. It's okay.

999
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.068
Come here.

1000
01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:30.616
What's wrong? I said it's okay.

1001
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.201
Come on.

1002
01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.328
Where are you going?

1003
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:37.206
Don't go!

1004
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.309
Twinkle? Look at Daddy.

1005
01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.312
You're not going, are you?

1006
01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:02.398
Twinkle, come to Daddy.

1007
01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:05.026
Come here.

1008
01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.364
Twinkle?

1009
01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:15.077
You little son of a bitch!

1010
01:05:43.564 --> 01:05:44.565
Where's the ring?

1011
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.942
Useless creature!

1012
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:49.278
I wasted so much time on her.
She didn't even understand me.

1013
01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:51.030
A dog's a dog, after all.

1014
01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.698
I needed that sweater.

1015
01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.575
I bought it for you!

1016
01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.911
It's mine!

1017
01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:02.124
I just saw Twinkle running up the hill.

1018
01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:06.420
She looked so healthy
the way she was moving.

1019
01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.547
I was so happy to see that.

1020
01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.216
Who cares about the stupid mutt?

1021
01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.760
-Are you out of your mind?
-What?

1022
01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.142
The excavator is coming!

1023
01:06:20.226 --> 01:06:22.186
Okay, let me think.

1024
01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:25.398
You gotta decide now!

1025
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:31.946
-We're out of time!
-Okay, I'm coming out.

1026
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.115
Wait, hold on.

1027
01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:43.499
There must be a way!

1028
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.376
I can do it!

1029
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.519
Fine, I give up! I'm coming out!

1030
01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:06.230
No!

1031
01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:08.065
That's it for today.

1032
01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.192
-Good work.
-You'll be back early?

1033
01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.194
Yes, 7:00 a.m. sharp.

1034
01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:13.362
I'm never late.

1035
01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.117
-Hey.
-What are you doing there?

1036
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.995
Just kidding. I'm not coming out.

1037
01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:22.747
Not leaving?

1038
01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:25.833
I have to lock up.
Get your car out of here.

1039
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.085
Sure.

1040
01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:31.047
Okay, I'll move my machine, too.

1041
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.548
Yeah, go home already.

1042
01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:34.675
Go on home!

1043
01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:39.597
Can't come here anymore.

1044
01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:47.980
It'll take ages to rebuild the place.

1045
01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:52.526
Which shower room should I visit now?

1046
01:08:31.065 --> 01:08:32.483
Scared the shit out me!

1047
01:08:40.491 --> 01:08:41.575
Min-sik…

1048
01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:50.209
Won't you please
let me join the Four Great Stars?

1049
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.545
You're not even doing it.

1050
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:56.924
Get some rest.

1051
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:07.059
Hi, Do-cheol.

1052
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.853
Did I wake you?

1053
01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.605
No, I'm not asleep yet.

1054
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.316
How was the audition?

1055
01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.319
It's all thanks to you.

1056
01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:20.030
The director liked the way my eyes looked.

1057
01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:22.950
Yeah, of course he did.

1058
01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.494
See?

1059
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:32.209
People take notice when you're sincere.

1060
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.589
Just like I noticed you.

1061
01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:39.300
I lived overseas.

1062
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.094
I have no connections over here.

1063
01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:44.889
All I have is myself.

1064
01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:46.599
But I remember what you told me.

1065
01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:49.268
"I, too, started with nothing."

1066
01:09:51.812 --> 01:09:52.771
Right.

1067
01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:54.648
I had nothing.

1068
01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.527
I didn't even know
why they hired me as an actor.

1069
01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.029
I know why.

1070
01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:03.616
Your sincerity always shines through.

1071
01:10:09.788 --> 01:10:11.498
Get ready for a film.

1072
01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:16.503
I was a fool to think about quitting.
I just couldn't wait.

1073
01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.255
That's how films are.

1074
01:10:21.091 --> 01:10:24.595
It might get made, or it might not.

1075
01:10:26.513 --> 01:10:30.059
It might get made, or it might…

1076
01:10:30.142 --> 01:10:31.936
Hello? In-pyo?

1077
01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:33.938
Sir?

1078
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.151
Honey, breakfast is ready.

1079
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:45.241
Just a few more minutes.

1080
01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.036
It will get cold. Get up, now.

1081
01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:53.874
Are you that tired?

1082
01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.543
I told you to go to bed earlier.

1083
01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:57.544
Get up already.

1084
01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.380
Okay.

1085
01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:10.975
What about you?

1086
01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:12.643
You can eat first.

1087
01:11:34.331 --> 01:11:35.749
It's so good.

1088
01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:47.344
Why are you so messy, honey?

1089
01:11:47.428 --> 01:11:49.054
Slow down.

1090
01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.307
You get messy as you grow old.

1091
01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:38.687
NO CARS, NO PARKING
ON DUTY

1092
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.342
Hi, Hyeon-a.

1093
01:13:08.425 --> 01:13:10.052
What's going on?

1094
01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.888
You're having a press conference tomorrow?

1095
01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:17.393
Yeah, In-pyo wanted to clear the air
about that election thing.

1096
01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:18.894
That's unfortunate.

1097
01:13:18.977 --> 01:13:21.772
We're shooting the talk show
at 7:00 tomorrow morning.

1098
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:24.942
Tomorrow at 7:00?

1099
01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:28.195
Why so early?

1100
01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:32.366
No need to come if you can't make it.
We'll be fine.

1101
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:33.909
No.

1102
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.995
Of course, we will be there on time.

1103
01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.497
But we're really okay if--

1104
01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:42.793
No, I'll explain it to In-pyo.

1105
01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:46.463
Yes. The shoot always comes first.

1106
01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.633
I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you.

1107
01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.431
Is she insane?

1108
01:13:56.515 --> 01:14:00.436
How could she call me now
and ask him to come by 7:00 a.m. tomorrow?

1109
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.319
How can I do this alone?

1110
01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:17.202
In-pyo, I'm here. Get ready.

1111
01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:22.249
You okay down there?

1112
01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:25.669
Do you have any water?

1113
01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.422
Hang in there.

1114
01:14:28.505 --> 01:14:31.550
You said grabbing shit
is like hitting the jackpot.

1115
01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.552
What bullshit.

1116
01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:36.847
You call this a jackpot?

1117
01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:38.515
I'm getting you out now.

1118
01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:01.997
Hey, be careful!

1119
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:03.332
I'm sorry.

1120
01:15:04.124 --> 01:15:05.125
Let's do that again.

1121
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:06.126
In-pyo.

1122
01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:10.756
This time, could you
please push on your end, too?

1123
01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:32.986
Nope.

1124
01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:36.198
It's impossible. I can't.

1125
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:40.452
How can you give up already
when you didn't even try yet?

1126
01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:46.166
I'm trying my best.

1127
01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:50.337
You call that trying?

1128
01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.547
Yes, I'm trying.

1129
01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:53.632
That didn't sound sincere.

1130
01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:59.596
Fuck! What's that even supposed to mean?

1131
01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.474
What? Did you say, "Fuck"?

1132
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:06.103
Yes, fuck! You call for help
if you wanna get the fuck out of there.

1133
01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:07.896
What's fucking sincerity gotta do with it?

1134
01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.233
That's why you have a long way to go.
You don't understand others.

1135
01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:13.026
How can I?

1136
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:17.197
All you care about is that
people are gonna see your dick.

1137
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.699
Of course, I am!

1138
01:16:18.782 --> 01:16:20.576
I get it. It does matter.

1139
01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.911
But this is a whole other matter.

1140
01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:26.415
Who cares if they're naked
as long as they get rescued?

1141
01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:28.500
It's not that important.

1142
01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.545
Maybe not to people like you,
but it is to me.

1143
01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.880
I haven't even done a sex scene yet.

1144
01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.882
Don't judge others by your standards.

1145
01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.928
I don't believe this.

1146
01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:45.767
I mean, don't you care
whether you get rescued or not?

1147
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:47.311
Of course, I care.

1148
01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:50.647
But how I'm rescued
is the issue here. How!

1149
01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:55.277
Just cover your damn face.
People won't recognize your dick.

1150
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.487
Am I a criminal?
Why would I cover my face?

1151
01:16:57.988 --> 01:17:00.949
Even if I covered my face,
people would know it's me.

1152
01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:03.827
Let's stop here.

1153
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:06.204
Stop what? Do you even understand?

1154
01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:08.540
I'd destroy my image in a flash.
Decades of hard work.

1155
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.626
-Does my life look easy to you?
-No.

1156
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.210
I don't think so.

1157
01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:16.673
Do you even know what image you have?

1158
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:19.926
You're making a nice living
off of my image.

1159
01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:22.721
-So you better know.
-Please, stop!

1160
01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:28.769
Do you even know what your image is now?

1161
01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:31.563
What?

1162
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.569
It's all my fault.

1163
01:17:38.862 --> 01:17:41.031
I think I made you like this.

1164
01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:45.827
I've been beating around the bush,
trying not to hurt you,

1165
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.496
and it became toxic.

1166
01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:49.831
What are you saying?

1167
01:17:49.956 --> 01:17:51.792
"A gentleman," "a star,"

1168
01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:55.337
"a former top celebrity," my ass.

1169
01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:01.009
You're nothing but a has-been.
You're all washed up!

1170
01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:05.597
Oh, and that film?

1171
01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.392
It's actually going well.

1172
01:18:08.475 --> 01:18:10.477
You're just not part of it.

1173
01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:14.606
They fucking said
Cha In-pyo wouldn't attract investors.

1174
01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.441
That's why they changed actors.

1175
01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:22.864
As soon as Ryu Seung-ryong
took over your role, they got the money.

1176
01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.325
They said Cha In-pyo
won't attract investors!

1177
01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:32.249
Open your eyes.

1178
01:18:32.916 --> 01:18:35.001
You bring in someone else?

1179
01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:36.712
Do-cheol?

1180
01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.381
You should worry about yourself.

1181
01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:41.216
He's way better than you.

1182
01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:49.099
But he hasn't done anything,
so he has no image to tarnish.

1183
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:53.395
Okay, got it. Let's stop there.

1184
01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.314
The talk show shoot is 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

1185
01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.735
I told her we have
a press conference at 9:00 a.m.

1186
01:19:00.318 --> 01:19:02.863
But she can't change the schedule for you.

1187
01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:07.534
You're optional.
It doesn't matter whether you're there.

1188
01:19:07.617 --> 01:19:09.161
Stop already.

1189
01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:11.204
That's enough.

1190
01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:15.459
You should at least know
when to step back.

1191
01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:18.211
I said enough. Stop it.

1192
01:19:19.045 --> 01:19:22.591
Are you ever gonna stop wagging
that goddamn finger?

1193
01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:32.058
You just don't get it.
You are the one who is tactless!

1194
01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:00.128
I'm sorry.

1195
01:20:03.256 --> 01:20:04.257
Me too.

1196
01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.683
I didn't mean it.

1197
01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:30.283
In-pyo!

1198
01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.453
In-pyo?

1199
01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.747
Hello? Talk to me!

1200
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.541
In-pyo!

1201
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.139
It's more than a talent.
It's my signature gesture.

1202
01:20:57.769 --> 01:20:59.563
Come on, it's totally your thing.

1203
01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.421
What's going on down there?

1204
01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.591
You fucking bastard!
You're dead when I get out of here!

1205
01:21:27.674 --> 01:21:29.593
-You son of a bitch!
-Gosh!

1206
01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:32.929
What's going on?

1207
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:34.973
Nothing.

1208
01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.683
You're…

1209
01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:39.185
No, it's really nothing.

1210
01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:41.104
You're that guy from earlier.

1211
01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:43.064
Hello.

1212
01:21:43.648 --> 01:21:44.941
Don't you "hello" me.

1213
01:21:46.109 --> 01:21:47.569
What are you doing here?

1214
01:21:47.652 --> 01:21:48.737
Oh, well…

1215
01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:50.864
Nothing.

1216
01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.451
Where do you think you're going?

1217
01:21:54.534 --> 01:21:56.411
Out with it.

1218
01:21:56.494 --> 01:21:58.204
Why are you really here?

1219
01:21:58.288 --> 01:21:59.539
-Get off me.
-What?

1220
01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:00.957
-My ring--
-Your ring?

1221
01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:02.083
Wait.

1222
01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.919
Come on.

1223
01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:05.420
-Mister.
-I want the truth.

1224
01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:08.673
You seemed shady from the start.

1225
01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.383
-What an iron grip.
-Why are you here?

1226
01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.719
-Get the fuck off me.
-How dare you?

1227
01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:15.430
You're in big trouble now!

1228
01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.891
-Let go!
-What are you planning?

1229
01:22:17.974 --> 01:22:19.392
Cut the crap!

1230
01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:23.396
I've got a plan.
I'm gonna get rid of all of you!

1231
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.273
Are we having a party tonight?

1232
01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:27.067
What is everyone doing here?

1233
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:29.110
What do you have there?

1234
01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.570
I got fired.

1235
01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:36.868
Thanks to all of your plotting,

1236
01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.578
I'm the only one who got fired!

1237
01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:42.499
What did I do wrong?

1238
01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.252
What did I ever do
to this goddamn building!

1239
01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:48.880
Come on, man.

1240
01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.966
It's over! Done!

1241
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:52.425
Over?

1242
01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:53.969
What's over?

1243
01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:56.304
My life is over?

1244
01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.223
Okay, I'll end it then!

1245
01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.434
Let's end this!

1246
01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:03.520
-No!
-It's over!

1247
01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:07.399
No, not there!

1248
01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:09.609
What's wrong with him?

1249
01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:11.945
Get off me!

1250
01:23:12.028 --> 01:23:14.280
Stop! No!

1251
01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:18.201
Stop it! Don't!

1252
01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.713
Don't try to stop me.

1253
01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:32.841
I'm going to kill myself,
so don't even try!

1254
01:23:46.312 --> 01:23:47.981
What the fuck is that?

1255
01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:51.401
This is seriously messed up.

1256
01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:54.029
Why do you care if I live or die?

1257
01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:56.740
Just step away from there.

1258
01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.658
Let's talk it out over here.

1259
01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:00.201
No, you come here.

1260
01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.705
We can die together! Come closer!

1261
01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.878
Hello? Yes, I want to
report a crime in progress.

1262
01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:12.213
If I die, you will see.

1263
01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:14.340
You'll see the truth!

1264
01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.886
-You better hurry!
-Please don't!

1265
01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:22.640
Please, I beg you, sir.

1266
01:24:25.351 --> 01:24:26.770
I beg you.

1267
01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:27.937
What am I to you?

1268
01:24:28.855 --> 01:24:30.440
Why would you beg?

1269
01:24:32.942 --> 01:24:34.402
Stop acting like you care!

1270
01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:37.530
You can think

1271
01:24:38.364 --> 01:24:40.700
whatever you want.

1272
01:24:41.284 --> 01:24:42.577
But this is not right.

1273
01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:44.579
You all think I'm a nobody.

1274
01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:48.541
You used me as a damn scapegoat.

1275
01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.335
I know exactly how you feel.

1276
01:24:50.835 --> 01:24:51.836
I know.

1277
01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:54.005
But it's just a building.

1278
01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.300
It's not worth losing your life over…

1279
01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:02.388
no matter what the truth is.

1280
01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:04.891
It's not that big a deal.

1281
01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.727
It may seem like it is,

1282
01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:10.939
but once it's all over,
you'll realize it's nothing.

1283
01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:12.565
I just…

1284
01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.194
I just want to live.

1285
01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:46.641
I saw it with my own eyes!
He was flying!

1286
01:25:46.724 --> 01:25:48.268
I'm not drunk!

1287
01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:52.772
Hey, I really appreciate it.

1288
01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.650
You'll be fine.
You were acting in self-defense.

1289
01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:57.277
Call me if you need anything.

1290
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.155
I would've smacked him down
if you weren't here.

1291
01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.239
Let's go.

1292
01:26:02.198 --> 01:26:03.491
Wait.

1293
01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.453
Can I make a quick call, please?

1294
01:26:27.891 --> 01:26:29.851
-Yes?
-Are you insane?

1295
01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:32.478
What are you doing down there?
Get out now!

1296
01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:36.482
Ae-ra.

1297
01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:39.611
Honey.

1298
01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.487
Don't you "honey" me.

1299
01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:45.408
I'm flying out tonight,
so stop playing around and come out.

1300
01:26:46.075 --> 01:26:47.076
Okay.

1301
01:26:47.827 --> 01:26:50.580
Are you crying right now?

1302
01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:53.791
Tears of happiness?
You've nothing to be proud of.

1303
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.627
I'm not proud of anything.

1304
01:26:58.421 --> 01:27:00.173
I just wanted to do well.

1305
01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.634
That's all.

1306
01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:06.679
What have I become?

1307
01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:09.724
Honey, come on. What's wrong?

1308
01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.688
I had it all wrong.

1309
01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:20.443
It's okay to make mistakes,

1310
01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:23.947
and it's okay to embarrass myself.

1311
01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:28.451
But I always thought I shouldn't.

1312
01:27:31.704 --> 01:27:32.872
I thought Cha In-pyo…

1313
01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:37.043
should never embarrass himself

1314
01:27:38.711 --> 01:27:41.005
and never look like a fool.

1315
01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.467
I thought I always had to look cool,

1316
01:27:45.551 --> 01:27:46.761
strong,

1317
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:50.640
gentle, and exemplary.

1318
01:27:51.599 --> 01:27:52.642
What was that?

1319
01:27:52.725 --> 01:27:55.770
I heard, "I had it all wrong."
Then what did you say?

1320
01:27:55.853 --> 01:27:57.063
I couldn't hear you.

1321
01:27:57.146 --> 01:27:58.439
No, it's okay.

1322
01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:02.193
Honey. Your "image" isn't important.

1323
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:06.447
Just be yourself.
Your sincerity will shine through.

1324
01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.285
Honey, I really miss you.

1325
01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:12.161
Stop crying, okay?

1326
01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:14.539
And I…

1327
01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:22.422
I lost my wagging finger.

1328
01:28:43.192 --> 01:28:46.404
I'm now at the scene
where Cha In-pyo is buried.

1329
01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:49.782
The rescue team
is carefully gearing up for the operation.

1330
01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:52.618
He was mentioned
as the opposition party's candidate.

1331
01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:56.414
He prepared a morning press conference
to address the matter.

1332
01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:59.292
It's not yet known why
Cha In-pyo is trapped

1333
01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:02.295
in the shower room
of a girls' high school.

1334
01:29:02.378 --> 01:29:04.922
The rescue will commence shortly.

1335
01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:13.389
What the hell? Now it's Cha In-pyo?

1336
01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:16.059
This is driving me crazy.

1337
01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:18.811
Why on earth would Cha In-pyo be here?

1338
01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.530
We found his clothes!

1339
01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:32.992
-They found his clothes!
-Are they Cha In-pyo's?

1340
01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:35.870
It's his jacket!

1341
01:29:35.953 --> 01:29:37.538
Is he naked?

1342
01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:40.124
It's the same jacket.

1343
01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:42.293
We got him.

1344
01:29:43.503 --> 01:29:46.339
We need more equipment and a stretcher!

1345
01:29:46.422 --> 01:29:49.133
Is that Cha In-pyo?

1346
01:29:50.301 --> 01:29:52.178
Who is Cha In-pyo?

1347
01:29:52.762 --> 01:29:56.849
I knew something was off
when I heard about the donation and stuff.

1348
01:29:57.433 --> 01:30:00.019
He's definitely running for office.

1349
01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:01.938
Right?

1350
01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:04.065
Don't give up now.

1351
01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.067
Stay strong.

1352
01:30:10.029 --> 01:30:10.947
All tied up!

1353
01:30:12.448 --> 01:30:13.616
Ready here!

1354
01:30:13.699 --> 01:30:15.243
You've done good so far.

1355
01:30:16.619 --> 01:30:19.330
You've nothing to be ashamed of.

1356
01:30:20.456 --> 01:30:21.457
Back!

1357
01:30:24.877 --> 01:30:25.878
Hold tight!

1358
01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:44.147
Something is stuck down there!

1359
01:30:51.237 --> 01:30:53.239
Wait a minute!

1360
01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:58.161
Lift it straight up!

1361
01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:08.796
I said wait…

1362
01:31:09.755 --> 01:31:12.383
You're doing great, Mr. Cha!

1363
01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:15.386
We're doing our best, too!

1364
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.596
Hang in there!

1365
01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.141
In-pyo, you can do it.

1366
01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.394
This is why

1367
01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.605
I worked out so hard!

1368
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.502
I see him! I see Mr. Cha!

1369
01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:49.837
Ready the rescue cage!

1370
01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:52.089
Mr. Cha!

1371
01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:56.010
We're lowering the rescue cage.

1372
01:31:58.471 --> 01:31:59.931
Raise it up!

1373
01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:01.766
There he is!

1374
01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:34.757
-Are you all right?
-Why were you down there?

1375
01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.468
-Were you nominated?
-Why are you at a girls' high school?

1376
01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.720
When did you decide
on a career in politics?

1377
01:32:41.138 --> 01:32:44.892
Do you even know what your image is now?

1378
01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:46.477
That didn't sound sincere.

1379
01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.938
Fuck! What's that even supposed to mean?

1380
01:32:49.313 --> 01:32:53.109
All you care about is that
people are gonna see your dick.

1381
01:32:53.192 --> 01:32:55.152
Your "image" isn't important.

1382
01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:59.657
Just be yourself.
Your sincerity will shine through.

1383
01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.242
Right.

1384
01:33:02.201 --> 01:33:04.328
I've nothing to be ashamed of.

1385
01:33:07.206 --> 01:33:11.794
My sincerity
shouldn't be covered by panties.

1386
01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:24.765
Jackpot.

1387
01:33:38.487 --> 01:33:40.489
Please make way. Coming through.

1388
01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:44.660
Please get out of the way.

1389
01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:48.623
There has been an article speculating
our party nominated Mr. Cha

1390
01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:51.375
as our candidate.

1391
01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.711
I'd like to state that this is not true.

1392
01:33:54.253 --> 01:33:56.172
SHOCKING NEWS! CHA IN-PYO'S RESCUE!

1393
01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:58.591
HE FLUNG RED PANTIES AT THE GIRLS' SCHOOL!

1394
01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:00.718
WILL HE REALLY RUN IN THE ELECTION?

1395
01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:04.639
Our leader expressed concerns about
harmful rumors surrounding an election

1396
01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:07.266
that should be truthful and transparent.

1397
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.060
-That's all.
-How are you?

1398
01:34:09.143 --> 01:34:12.521
We wish you could've been in the show.
What a shame.

1399
01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:17.193
But we're planning another show
called Four Great Body Stars.

1400
01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:20.321
You're so ripped from exercising
and eating chicken breast!

1401
01:34:20.404 --> 01:34:21.656
Hyeon-a.

1402
01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:23.824
-Gotta go.
-What? Wait--

1403
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:26.702
You were right.

1404
01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:30.831
Grabbing shit was like
hitting the jackpot.

1405
01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:35.086
Despite that incident,
I came back in one piece.

1406
01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:37.546
I guess…

1407
01:34:39.715 --> 01:34:41.509
I was too greedy.

1408
01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:46.347
You might want to explain the red panties.

1409
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:47.390
Forget it.

1410
01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:51.936
Only those who trust me would believe it.

1411
01:34:52.603 --> 01:34:54.271
Okay, get some rest.

1412
01:34:54.355 --> 01:34:55.690
-A-ram.
-Yes?

1413
01:34:57.983 --> 01:35:00.611
Were you reading those comments as is?

1414
01:35:02.071 --> 01:35:03.447
What comments?

1415
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.615
I found that one.

1416
01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:10.538
"I knew he'd do it
after that volunteer work."

1417
01:35:11.914 --> 01:35:16.669
But I couldn't find where it said,
"Fucking scumbag."

1418
01:35:20.798 --> 01:35:22.341
Did you add that?

1419
01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:32.601
It's okay. Go.

1420
01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:34.562
Okay.

1421
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.782
Look how strong it is!

1422
01:35:47.783 --> 01:35:49.201
A BREATHTAKING STORY!

1423
01:35:49.285 --> 01:35:54.331
I'm on the set of First-Class Security
to talk to the cast members.

1424
01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.500
-Hello.
-Hi.

1425
01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.502
Hi, I'm Ryu Seung-ryong.

1426
01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.921
I play the role of Go Sang-gi,

1427
01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:03.299
the president's security guard.

1428
01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:07.803
Hi, I'm Choi Han-bi. I play Bang Hye-jin,
the president's daughter.

1429
01:36:08.387 --> 01:36:11.390
Hello, I play Kim Ji-hoon,
the newbie guard.

1430
01:36:11.474 --> 01:36:12.683
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN

1431
01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.518
I'm newbie actor Kang Do-cheol.

1432
01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:17.897
I do 1,500 push-ups every day.

1433
01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:21.734
I decided to be more self-confident
after hearing what you said.

1434
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.487
Would you like to see?

1435
01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.616
Geez.

1436
01:36:30.618 --> 01:36:32.119
Excuse me, what are you doing?

1437
01:36:33.245 --> 01:36:35.247
People actually walk through here.

1438
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:36.415
Get up now, please.

1439
01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.959
-Let's talk inside.
-Thank you.

1440
01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:47.092
You watched Healing Camp
more than 20 times?

1441
01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:49.845
Yes. And I watched Boss over 30 times.

1442
01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:50.971
Please take a seat.

1443
01:36:52.681 --> 01:36:55.893
You are my role model.

1444
01:36:58.229 --> 01:37:01.023
Kang Do-cheol is a rising star.

1445
01:37:01.106 --> 01:37:04.944
I heard you beat the odds
of 1 in 1,000 to win the role.

1446
01:37:05.027 --> 01:37:07.071
How did you get the audition?

1447
01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:11.742
I've had a role model
ever since I was little.

1448
01:37:12.868 --> 01:37:15.329
I was determined to learn not only acting

1449
01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:18.082
but also the lifestyle from him.

1450
01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:20.709
So I couldn't miss
this golden opportunity.

1451
01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:24.421
Who is this role model?

1452
01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:26.340
He is

1453
01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.468
my mentor and adviser.

1454
01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:33.138
Ryu Seung-ryong!

1455
01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.728
-You're making me blush.
-You know I admire you.

1456
01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.108
This is so sweet.

1457
01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:46.277
Sure.

1458
01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.072
I'm happy to see you succeed.

1459
01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.909
You ungrateful fucking bastard.

1460
01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:56.620
THIS FILM IS DEDICATED
TO THE ACTOR CHA IN-PYO

1461
01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:59.415
You said it's fiction.
Why is it dedicated to me?

1462
01:38:00.499 --> 01:38:03.419
You think I'm stupid?
They're trying to make a fool of me.

1463
01:38:03.502 --> 01:38:04.503
6 MONTHS LATER

1464
01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:06.046
Get out now.

1465
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:09.133
-What about a comeback?
-Why bother?

1466
01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:12.052
Take it away.

1467
01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:13.804
You were the icon of optimism.

1468
01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.724
Don't let that little incident
turn you into a pessimist.

1469
01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:18.559
A little incident?

1470
01:38:19.768 --> 01:38:22.605
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

1471
01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:26.942
If it was you,
you'd have already lost your mind.

1472
01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:30.613
Little incident, my ass.

1473
01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:37.620
Don't bring me things like this again.

1474
01:38:41.624 --> 01:38:43.918
Mr. Cha, what's "resurrection"?

1475
01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:45.502
Kim Tae-won's song?

1476
01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.962
Not that.

1477
01:38:47.046 --> 01:38:49.506
What do you have to do to be resurrected?

1478
01:38:50.549 --> 01:38:52.384
What do you have to do?

1479
01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:55.596
You have to die first.

1480
01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:57.139
Die?

1481
01:38:59.975 --> 01:39:00.809
Go on.

1482
01:39:00.893 --> 01:39:03.896
I have a plan to bring you back to life.

1483
01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:08.317
How will you bring me back?

1484
01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:10.945
Think about it.

1485
01:39:11.779 --> 01:39:16.241
What do people think of
when they hear the name Cha In-pyo?

1486
01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:18.827
What is it?

1487
01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:22.247
I suppose

1488
01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:24.959
there's just one thing.

1489
01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:27.378
And that is…

1490
01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:30.255
CHA IN-PYO

1491
01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:12.334
